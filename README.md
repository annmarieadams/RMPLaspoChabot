## RMPLaspoChabot
Very simple chrome extension that opens a Rate My Professors search on highlighted text. 
# How to enable the extension
Navigate to More tools -> Extensions in Chrome's menu bar. Check "Developer Mode" and then select "Load Unpacked Extension". Navigate to the folder containing RMPLaspoChabot's files. 
# How to use the extension
Highlight a professor's name and right click to bring up a context menu. Click on the "Search for (highlighted text) on RMP" option.
By default this extension only searches for professors at Chabot College. If you would like to search for professors at Las Positas College (or any other college) you can open background.js in an editor and modify the schoolID and schoolName variables to reflect your school's ID and name on Rate My Professors. 

I would suggest deleting or disabling this extension when you are done using it to avoid crowding the context menu.
